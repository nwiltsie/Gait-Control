Running the robot: 
Download and run firmware/firmware.pde on the Arduino, then run "python walk.py" and the robot should (theoretically) start walking.

Configuring the robot:
Things that are likely to need configuration on the PC side are stored in config.py. The speed at which the Arduino executes each motion can be adjusted in firmware.pde
